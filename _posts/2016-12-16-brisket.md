@19:23, pulled, then rested for one hour

for next time:
* seemed slightly salty, should mix salt/pepper before applying to meat

for leftover hash, used ratio as follows approximately:
* shredded potato : brisket :: 2.5-3 : 1
* shredded potato and coooked onions and garlic
* baked at 350 for 15 minutes then broiled for 5 minutes, eggs on top are nice
* add more hot sauce
